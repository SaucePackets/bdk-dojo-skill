# bdk-dojo-skill

BDK Dojo is a Bitcoin/Rust learning skill bundle for Hermes and OpenClaw.

It turns Bitcoin wallet concepts into small, testable Rust katas. The goal is practical skill: understand wallet primitives, write clear Rust, build test discipline, and grow toward credible open-source Bitcoin contribution.

BDK Dojo does **not** build a production wallet. It builds simplified, toy versions of components that BDK supports so learners understand the machinery before using the real library: UTXO tracking, balance categories, sync state, reorg handling, address index tracking, fee math, coin selection, transaction proposals, PSBT-style review, wallet errors, and descriptor mental models.

The cumulative reference crate at `examples/bdk-dojo-wallet/` is a functional training engine. It does not connect to testnet/signet/regtest, validate a real chain, manage keys, sign transactions, broadcast transactions, or protect funds. Real networked wallet work comes later through `bdk_wallet`, Esplora/Electrum/bitcoind backends, and safe regtest or signet examples.

## What this includes

- `skills/bdk-dojo/SKILL.md` — the teaching workflow and guardrails.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/lesson-template.md` — reusable lesson format.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/answer-validation.md` — correctness checks: expected behavior, tests, reference crate comparison.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/context-discipline.md` — compact load order so agents do not overload context.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/teach-mode.md` — AI teacher behavior: hints, review, verification, progress notes.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/bitcoin-dojo-format.md` — repo/scaffold format adapted from `SaucePackets/bitcoin-dojo`.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/bdk-learning-coverage.md` — coverage checklist for Rust, wallet concepts, BDK bridge work, testing, and contribution readiness.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/course-spine.md` — cumulative lesson plan that prevents repeated logic.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/progress-journal.md` — private learner progress/pain-point journal format.
- `skills/bdk-dojo/references/wallet-balance-utxo-model.md` — first beginner kata.
- `scaffold/` — Bitcoin Dojo-style numbered exercise directories; each ready lesson has its own `README.md` and `stubs.rs`.
- `examples/bdk-dojo-wallet/` — cumulative working Rust wallet-training crate.
- `examples/wallet-balance-kata/` — legacy runnable Rust starter kata.
- `docs/install-hermes.md` and `docs/install-openclaw.md` — runtime install notes.

## Who it is for

- Rust beginners who want Bitcoin-shaped practice.
- Bitcoin meetup study groups.
- Developers exploring BDK concepts before touching real wallet code.
- Future contributors building the habits maintainers trust: small changes, tests, clear explanations.

## Learning stance

This is not passive AI tutoring.

The learner writes first. The agent coaches, hints, reviews, verifies, and refactors after the attempt.

## First kata

The cumulative working crate starts here:

```bash
cd examples/bdk-dojo-wallet
cargo test
cargo run
```

Work through the numbered scaffold directories:

```bash
find scaffold -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d | sort
```

Like `SaucePackets/bitcoin-dojo`, there is no central scaffold index. A lesson is teachable when its directory exists and contains both `README.md` and `stubs.rs`. The scaffold set now covers the planned course spine as real exercises with tests and reference implementations, not placeholders.

The older runnable starter remains available:

```bash
cd examples/wallet-balance-kata
cargo test
cargo run
```

That kata models confirmed, trusted pending, untrusted pending, and total spendable balance buckets.

## Roadmap

The real roadmap lives in `skills/bdk-dojo/references/course-spine.md` and follows the scaffold/test format described in `skills/bdk-dojo/references/bitcoin-dojo-format.md`.

Short shape:

- Phase 1: wallet primitives — amounts, UTXOs, balances, wallet state, confirmations, spendability.
- Phase 2: sync mental model — sync events, checkpoints, reorgs, address index.
- Phase 3: spending decisions — fee rates, coin selection, dust, transaction proposals.
- Phase 4: PSBT and review discipline — review checklist, errors, full toy send flow.
- Phase 5: BDK bridge — compare to BDK examples, descriptors, safe regtest/signet skeleton, contribution drill.

## Note

This repo is intentionally public-clean. It does not include private learning history, personal critique logs, or live progress ledgers.
